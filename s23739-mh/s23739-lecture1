My diary, after today's UKOS lectures (17-10-2020), I've learned:
-About all of the system folders and their contents
For example: bin - Contains all of the most important binaries (windows equivalent for executables)
- How to use Git repositories
- About relative and absolute paths
- About using basic terminal commands
- This is shebang: #!
- About Differences between Windows and Linux
Overall, the lecture was great!
